  career_blurb: |-
    I started developing for the web in 2008. I now have a decade of experience working with large apps, and I'm familiar with the newest and most popular technologies.

    This site you're reading is made with [Rails 5](http://rubyonrails.org), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). It's deployed to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org), [Nginx](http://nginx.org), and [Puma](http://puma.io). View the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/stedwick/resume).
