  career_blurb: "<div class='col-12 col-lg-6'><p>Hello! I'm Philip, and I started
    developing for the web at a startup in NYC in 2007. Fast-forward ten years and
    here I am in Portland with a decade of experience working on large apps using
    the best and most popular technologies.</p></div>\n  \n  <div class='col-12 col-lg-6'><p>This
    site you're reading now is made with [Rails 5](http://rubyonrails.org), [Bootstrap
    4](https://getbootstrap.com), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). It's
    deployed to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

  skills_blurb: 
  education_blurb: I majored in mathematics in college and grad school, and my first
    career was as a teacher in New York City. However, I always loved computers and
    quickly transitioned to my new career as a developer.
  work_blurb: "<div class='col-12 col-lg-6'><p>I started in tech as an analyst at
    Brightidea back in 2007 when I was 25. At that time, I was transitioning away
    from mathematics and education. I taught myself Ruby on Rails and was hired a
    year later at readMedia as their first full-time developer. We grew the company
    and turned it into what Merit is today.</p></div>\n  \n  <div class='col-12 col-lg-6'><p>It
    was a startup environment, and I didn't just develop in Ruby &mdash; I did everything:
    DB & server administration and deployment, cloud scaling and automation, security,
    and project management. My passion has always been to build great products with
    great technologies.</p></div>"
  projects_blurb: "<span class='projects_blurb'>I often program for fun, and you can
    browse my side projects on GitHub. I once [wrote a Ruby script](https://github.com/stedwick/scripting/blob/master/daily_tix.rb)
    to nab myself tickets to The Daily Show, which was first-come-first-serve on its
    website at the time, and you never knew when tickets would become available.</span>"
  old_blurb: I work with all the current tools and platforms for Ruby on Rails web
    development. I'm constantly trying out the cutting-edge as well, such as Docker.
  personal_blurb: I maintain a healthy work/life balance. If you'd like to learn more
